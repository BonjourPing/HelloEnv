    but I'm going to hold off on cleaning them up until I'm sure this change
    is permanent.

    Proactively detect Git dir if autocommand hasn't triggered
    
    This is a little clunky, but enabling !empty(FugitiveGitDir()) to work
    in autocommands that trigger before ours should provide an acceptable
    replacement for the "User Fugitive" event and will hopefully enable us
    to unltimately eliminate preemptive detection entirely.

    Don't use pty on win32unix
    
    This appears to work fine in some setups, but has the same problems
    as regular win32 in others.  Most notably, for it to work properly with
    the Vim included with Git for Windows, the experimental pseudo console
    support must not be enabled.  Lacking a method to distinguish between
    the two cases, I see no better option than disabling it on all win32unix
    installations.

    Fix undesired line wrap in :Git output
    
    If Vim is 100 columns wide, and we echo a string exactly 100 characters
    long, Vim will insert a line break that a terminal wouldn't.  This is
    particularly noticeable with progress bars that Git erases with a screen
    width's worth of whitespace.  Work around this by decreasing the number
    of columns by 1.

    Allow close callback to run before leaving job wait loop
    
    Apparently, both job_status() == "dead" and ch_status() == "closed"
    isn't enough to guarantee all callbacks have run.  One last sleep seems
    to do the trick, but let's also add a sanity check because this can
    cause confusing, hard to debug behavior.

    Echo from wait loop, not job callback
    
    This makes the pager behave a better, allowing the -- More -- prompt to
    actually display and not dropping output if the process exits while
    there's a backlog.  An additional benefit is if Git for some reason
    produces additional output while GIT_EDITOR is running, that output will
    be buffered rather than interrupting the user.
    
    The extracted s:RunTick() helper changes the Vim behavior to check the
    process status after waiting as well as before.  This brings it in line
    with how Neovim's jobwait() appears to work.
    
    The zero argument :echo after the final s:RunEcho() clears up some weird
    draw issues with `:Git command|someothercommand`.

    Retool :Git blame colored commits
    
    Use 3 characters of the commit hash rather than 6, limiting the maximum
    total declarations to 4,096 rather than 16 million. Avoid color
    components lower than 0x20 and higher than 0xdf to help avoid colors
    that blend into the background, light or dark.  And for the terminal,
    replace the use of CSApprox with a simple usage of the 6x6x6 color cube
    found on 256 color terminals.  CSApprox aims to provide accurate
    replication of the input colors, whereas our goal is simply to use all

    Use git --list-cmds= to complete subcommands
    
    For older Git versions, use the list of subcommands from when
    --list-cmds= was first added, and subtract out "worktree" for Git
    versions too old to have it.  This one simple conditional gives us
    accurate completion for Git versions up to a decade old.
    
    The option is described as "internal/experimental", so make sure the
    exit status is successful, and filter out anything that looks like a
    warning or deprecation notice.  In case of failure, use the commands
    provided by --list-cmds= as of the date of this commit.

    Expand ssh host aliases in remote urls
    
    A common practice for using multiple accounts with a hosting service
    such as GitHub is to alias the host in ~/.ssh/config and use an
    alternate ssh key to authenticate as the alternate user:
    
            Host github.com-work
                    HostName github.com
                    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
    
    By swapping in the original host name for the alias in
    FugitiveRemoteUrl(), we can enable :GBrowse plugins to correctly
    recognize the hosting service's domain name.
    
    If for some reason you need the original URL without modification, pass
    a true value as the third parameter:
    
            let url = FugitiveRemoteUrl('', bufnr(''), 1)

    Retool discard operation during conflict
    
    The use of --theirs for Unstaged and --ours for Staged was based
    entirely on the way conflicts were represented in git status --short,
    except, that's backwards, the staged column contains our side of the
    merge so discarding it should use --theirs.  I never noticed because I
    don't use this feature.
    
    Fixing this is guaranteed to burn anybody who learned the whole
    behavior, so let's promote 2X and 3X to official status, and require
    opting in to the flipped default.
    
    Also, since --ours and --theirs only touch the worktree, the correct
    analogous operations for deletion is *not* git rm, but rather to remove
    the worktree file directly.  So let's do that, and add it to 2X and 3X
    too.

    Remove Git dir checks on FileType events
    
    In order for these checks to work, :filetype on must be invoked *after*
    Fugitive is loaded.  Otherwise, the FileType event triggers before
    FugitiveDetect() is called.
    
    These file types are used almost exclusively inside of Git repositories,
    and in the rare case they are not, we're not doing anything particularly
    intrusive, so dropping the conditional should have little practical
    impact.  An exception is fugitive#MapJumps(), which is designed to be
    used exclusively with historical buffers, the status buffer, and
    captured :Git output, so let's lock it down to those particular
    workflows.

    Set b:git_dir early in BufReadCmd
    
    We call :setlocal filetype=git before manually triggering BufReadPost,
    which means that the FileType events in the plugin file containing
    len(FugitiveGitDir()) checks all short circuited.  This wasn't noticed
    before because:
    
    * They're mostly nonessential, save for fugitive#MapJumps() which we
      also explicitly invoke in BufReadCmd.
    * If :filetype on is invoked *after* Fugitive is loaded, then it will
      set the filetype a second time *after* we've properly set b:git_dir.
      (This was the case on my machine, except when reloading the plugin
      redefined the autocommands and thus reversed the order.)
    
    The load order issue is also relevant to plain file buffers.  This will
    require an additional fix.

    Resolve temp name used in :Git
    
    This will enable us to use the temp name in a job backed --paginate.
    Since temp file names have been the subject of various issues on win32
    in the past, let's make this change sooner rather than later to get a
    head start on any bug reports.

    Use stderr for in-band job communication
    
    Since stdout can contain arbitrary user data, let's touch it as little
    as possible.  When using a pty, this has no effect, as everything goes
    through stdout, but I aim to move handle --paginate with this same
    pipeline, and that will not use a pty.

    Given that `czw` keeps working without confirmation and that there
    is a separate `cz<Space>` map - seems like the change was not intended?

    Favor :Ggrep over :Git grep
    
    I'm starting to think :Git grep shouldn't be special cased.
    Occasionally it is desirable to see grep results without clobbering the
    quickfix list.
    
    Reserve -O/--open-files-in-pager to opt into quickfix behavior, as this
    fits well with Fugitive's use of a temp buffer as the Git pager.

    Drop support for :{windowheight}Git
    
    Ever since Vim gained -addr=, it's been impossible to define a command
    that accepts both marks like '< (requires -addr=lines) an and a count
    that's beyond the end of the file (requires -addr=other).  This means
    :Git needs to pick sides between :'<,'>Git blame and :{windowheight}Git
    log, and the former is much more important than the latter.

    This is primarily intended so users can define their own :Gpush and
    :Gfetch when they lose their :Dispatch backed async.

    Remove most uses of s:EchoExec()
    
    This function was intended to avoid the press ENTER prompt for brief
    output, but the new :Git job based runner now does that more
    effectively.  Remove all old uses of it except the U map, which I am
    electing to keep quiet on older versions of Vim.

    Remove old :Git! temp buffer behavior
    
    Rip the band-aid off now so we can reclaim it for something else sooner
    rather than later.
    
    If you're trying to support both old and new versions of Fugitive,
    exists('*FugitiveConfigGetAll') will be true on versions where
    --paginate is supported.  In a pinch you can also swap in :Gsplit!, but
    that's eventually going away too.

    Refine handling of pagination via temp buffer
    
    Use temp buffer for output of any command for which the Git
    configuration option of pager.<command> is true.  Avoid using a temp
    buffer if the value is false, even for commands like "show" where we
    normally would.  If the configuration value is present and can't be
    interpreted as a Boolean, punt to a :terminal where Git will invoke it
    directly.
    
    Generate and use custom config dictionary that includes -c values passed
    to :Git.  This enables `:Git -c pager.status status` to correctly use a
    pager.
    
    Paginate "config", "branch", and "tag" for certain argument lists,
    matching the logic found in the Git source code as closely as possible.
    These 3 commands were identified as having special pagination logic by
    the presence of the DELAY_PAGER_CONFIG flag on their definitions in
    git.c.
    
    Paginate "am --show-current-patch".

    Add capitalized versions of non-standard commands
    
    The long term goal is to use :Gsomecommand for commands that wrap
    Vim built-ins (e.g., :Gedit for :edit), :Git some-command for commands
    that wrap Git built-ins, and :GSomeCommand for everything else.  For
    :GRemove, :GDelete, :GMove, and :GRename, this gives us symmetry with
    eunuch.vim, and for :GBrowse, this gives us symmetry with a hypothetical
    :Browse command that I've long wanted to make a plugin for but probably
    never will.
    
    :GcLog and :GlLog get their names because they match Vim's :c and :l
    prefixes but bring their own custom suffix.  This is rather unsatisfying
    and I may change it if something better comes along.

    Change :Git --paginate from :terminal to temp buffer
    
    The --paginate option to Git forces it to use $PAGER rather than its own
    configuration, so it makes perfect sense for Fugitive to take on the
    role of the pager.
    
    This also removes the same behavior for --no-pager, allowing the command
    to run with :! instead.  I really don't like sudden backwards
    incompatible changes like this, but the old behavior was based on a bad
    understanding of how these options work, and I'd rather rip the band-aid
    off sooner rather than later.

    Begin phasing out :Git --paginate special case
    
    This was a mistake.  I took --paginate to be the opposite of --no-pager,
    but it forces $PAGER over $GIT_PAGER and pager configuration.  This
    defeats the purpose of using it as way to trick :Git into running a
    regular command with :terminal.

    repository.

    Reset scrollbind/cursorbind after reblaming
    
    The following sequence of commands leaves the buffer with scrollbind and
    cursorbind set:
    
      :Gblame
      Reblame with one of -, ~, or P
      Quit with gq
    
    What's happening here is:
    
    1. In BlameSubcommand, we set scrollbind and cursorbind on the buffer.
       We also set w:fugitive_leave on the blame buffer to reset scrollbind
       and cursorbind when the blame buffer is closed.
    2. In BlameJump, we execute Gedit, which changes the window to a new
       buffer. Then, we delete the blame buffer, at which point we try to
       reset scrollbind and cursorbind. However, the original buffer isn't
       on a window anymore, so this doesn't do anything.
    3. In BlameQuit, we go back to the original buffer. Note this snippet
       from `:help local-options`: "if this buffer has been edited in this
       window, the [option] values from back then are used". When the
       original buffer was last used, scrollbind and cursorbind were still
       set. Therefore, the buffer ends up with scrollbind and cursorbind
       set after leaving Gblame.
    
    The fix is to delete the blame buffer _before_ changing to the new
    buffer in BlameJump. This ensures that we restore the options while the
    original buffer is still around (which is how BlameQuit does it, too).

    Fix error message on blank buffer with no Git dir

commit 427ac52d7dab4f0950da0662416561095d6cc15d
Author: Tim Pope <code@tpope.net>
Date:   Thu Oct 10 19:47:39 2019 -0400

    fugitive.vim 3.1
    
    * Commands are now global, not buffer local.
    * Calling a command in an unnamed buffer uses the working directory.
    * Preserve line number on :Gedit to return to work tree buffer.
    * Better submodule support in :Gstatus.
    * Support git-blame revision ignoring features.
    * Show first parent diff in merge commit buffer.
    * Remove deprecated support for .git/tags.
    * Bug fixes.

    Fix incorrect script id (part 2)
    
    This is a follow-up to 28abadc.
    
    Without the \zs, everything up to the regexp for the script ID would be
    used.
    
    Now, s:function() is the same as the one used in scriptease.

    Rudimentary support for diff maps for submodules in status

    Support X for submodules
    
    Staged/[MD]:
    Unstage and checkout superproject recorded version
    
    Staged/A:
    Noop. 'git rm -f' would be appropriate but it is destructive for
    non-staged changes and hard to undo
    
    Unstaged/A:
    Noop. Hard to reproduce in practice, 'git status' doesn't handle it well
    and hard to undo
    
    Unstaged/[MD]:
    Checkout superproject recorded version
    
    Unstaged/[m?]:
    Noop. Discarding submodules content changes is too complicated.
    Workaround is to <CR> to submodule and discard from it's :Gstatus.

    Add --porcelain=v2 status parser
    
    New submodule modifiers:
    
    - 'M' if submodule commit is changed, otherwise
    - '?' if there is modified or untracked content
    
    Keep using v1 parser for git versions older than 2.11. This will display
    'M' for any submodule changes.

    Fix reverse blame jump for the boundary edge case
    
    When the line is reverse-blamed to an *immediate* child of the current
    commit it is shown as `^commit` in the reverse blame output. In this
    case we still need to open the child of this commit since it will be a
    commit removing the line.

    fugitive.vim 3.0
    
    * Use custom format for :Gstatus, not literal git status output.
    * Inline diffing in :Gstatus, with support for staging individual hunks.
    * List unpushed and unpulled commits in :Gstatus.
    * Show rebase status in :Gstatus.
    * Greatly expanded set of mappings in :Gstatus. Try g?, c?, and r?.
    * :Gstatus p (add --patch) is changed to P.
    * :Gstatus U (checkout/clean) is changed to X. New U behavior is global reset.
    * :Gstatus 2X/3X performs checkout --ours/--theirs.
    * :Gstatus gI ignores file.
    * Smarter :Gstatus automatic reload.
    * :Git subcommand calls :Gsubcommand when appropriate.
    * :Git add --patch and similar commands use :terminal.
    * :Git diff, :Git log, and :Git --no-pager display results in temp buffer.
    * :Git and subcommand wrappers use custom quoting rather than shell escaping.
    * :Git ... ./path is relative to working directory.
    * Add --option completion to :Git and git wrappers.
    * Provide :G as wrapper for both :Gstatus and :Git.
    * Support for :Grebase --interactive.
    * :Gblame accepts all arguments, including filenames and commits.
    * Support :Gblame --reverse to navigate forwards through history.
    * Support :Gblame with range to blame subset of current file.
    * Allow disabling dynamic blame colors with let g:fugitive_dynamic_colors = 0.
    * :Glog opens quickfix list instead of displaying raw log output.
    * Cleaner :Glog quickfix list leveraging Vim's new "module" format.
    * :Glog no longer defaults to current file.  Use :0Glog for that.
    * :0Glog follows file across renames.
    * :Glog name softly deprecated in favor of :Gclog (named after :cfile).
    * Provide :Grevert.
    * :Gdiff renamed to :Gdiffsplit.
    * :Gdiffsplit always opens one window.  Use :Gdiffsplit! for conflicts.
    * Support git grep --column.
    * Chdir with git -C rather than :cd for most commands. (Git 1.8.5 required)
    * Show all stderr hook output on :Gcommit.
    * Provide core.askPass default for Gpush and friends.
    * Require bang to :Gwrite from index.
    * Bug fixes.
    * Polish.

    Expose IO functions as object
    
    This is a new interface to a slightly older API for performing standard
    VimL IO functions against URLs (or any other URLs, the interface is
    generic).  Example wrapper function:
    
           function! IO(fn, ...) abort
             let file = a:fn ==# 'writefile' ? a:2 : a:1
             let obj = get(g:, 'io_' . matchstr(file, '^\a\a\+'), {})
             return call(get(obj, a:fn, a:fn), a:000)
           endfunction
           echo IO('filereadable', @%)

    Fix -1 effectively canceling --reverse
    
    Is there a way to apply a limit at the print level rather than the query
    level?

    Provide some commit --reset-author maps
    
    Supporting flags with additional maps is a pretty limited solution, as
    there's no way to combine them (that is, we'd need to map both cRva and
    cvRa to get both verbose and reset-author, and that's as silly as it is
    hard to type in under a second).  I think some kind of getchar()
    dispatcher is going to be the long term solution.

    This was added to compensate for the implicit autowrite we lost when

    I don't fully understand it but it's easy to prevent.

    The distant future might hold a :Glog command that isn't bound by the

    :Gcgrep is a weird name since it directly maps to :grep, but provide it
    anyways for symmetry.

    Retool diffing
    
    Support mods, rename to match the built-in :diffsplit, and (perhaps
    controversially) move three-way diffing to the bang variant, so that the
    default behavior always focuses the other window.

    Unify :G and :Git

    Update escaping for dynamic :Git invocations

    Don't rely on shell for quoting
    
    Using shell syntax for Fugitive commands has a number of disadvantages:
    
    * Commands behave differently depending on shell and platform.
    * Checking for arguments (e.g., did :Ggrep receive --cached?) is
      impossible to do robustly.
    * Double quoted strings conflict with -bar command chaining.
    * Need to use %:S to for expansions, and backslash escaping even inside
      single quotes.
    
    This is an experiment that instead implements the quoting ourselves.
    
    For backwards compatibility, :Git and :Gcommit support double quoted
    strings, but this is deprecated.

    I believe I omitted BufNewFile here because it seemed like kind of a
    silly event for an unmodifiable, unwritable buffer, but I wasn't taking
    into account that event is needed for Fugitive to activate.

    Fix autocmds & alternate file handling for "index"
    
    This commit tweaks the existing autocommand for files matching
    `index{,.lock}` to:
    
      - Fire BufReadPre and BufReadPost on either side of the read
        operation for files not in a `.git/` and already extant.
      - Fire BufNewFile for new files not in a `.git`.
      - Add `keepalt` to the `read`, thus allowing alternative file
        operations such as Ctrl-^ to work correctly.
    
    Has been tested against:
    
      - BufReadPost,BufNewFile autocommands
      - A basic test case for alternate files where one is named `index`

    Move filetype to after maps to allow user maps
    
    The easiest way for users to define their own maps in Gstatus buffers is
    using a ftplugin/fugitive.vim file with a `b:fugitive_type != 'index'`
    guard. Setting the filetype after defining the maps allows users to
    maniuplate "dangerous" maps and otherwise customize mappings.
    
    For example, in ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/fugitive.vim:
    
        if !exists('g:loaded_fugitive') || b:fugitive_type != 'index'
            finish
        endif

    Allow ShellCmdPost to fire inside :Make
    
    This was trying to block `au QuickFixCmdPost * copen` as it interfered
    with restoring the working directory, but that was mainly a concern for
    the other half of the conditional, so restore it to enable the status
    buffer to reload.

    Fix commit maps while accommodating bad modelines
    
    We need modifiable off for the maps to kick in, but we need to turn it

    modeline modifies the buffer with an option like fileencoding, which you
    should never do, stop doing it.

    Rename Fugitive revisions to Fugitive objects
    
    Neither term is great, as they both exclude work tree files in Git

    BufReadObject: handle rev-parse errors
    
    With `:Gdiff ^` on a file that has just been added, you would get an
    error via `git rev-parse --verify`:
    
    > fatal: Needed a single revision
    
    The error message is clearer when not using `--verify`:
    
    > fatal: Path 'X' exists on disk, but not in 'SHA'.
    
    The behavior depends on if you use `:set hidden`, where the second
    invocation works, as in will open an empty buffer - apparently since it
    has been created as "a buffer with read errors" ("x" in `:ls!`) before.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/issues/866.

    As of scrooloose/nerdtree@d36b793, it was recommended to use
    NERDTree.root instead of deprecated NERDTreeRoot. Also, this command
    seems to be recently removed since it was throwing an Undefined
    variable: b:NERDTreeRoot when starting Vim.

    Do not accept :Gread count in argument position
    
    Use `-range` instead of `-count` to prevent Vim from interpreting a
    branch name starting with a number as a count, e.g. `:Gread 123-foo`
    being interpreted as `:123Gread -foo`.

    Work around Vim issue with hidden diff window
    
    If you call :Gdiff on a file that's also open in a separate tab, close
    it, switch to another file, and call :Gdiff again, Vim thinks the first
    file is part of a 3-way diff, despite no longer being displayed in a
    window.  Curiously, :diffoff! seems to work around this, despite both
    the documentation and source code suggesting it merely iterates over
    open windows.

    Add g:fugitive_git_command
    
    The idea is that g:fugitive_git_command is for user facing commands and
    suitable to be changed to something like "hub", while
    g:fugitive_git_executable is for low level internals.

    Fix temp_files cache on Windows when TEMP is set to a short path (#893)
    
    If %TEMP% is set to a short path (e.g. "C:\LongDi~1") then tempname()
    will return a file name that contains that short path. If that path is
    later used as key for entry in s:temp_files dictionary, that entry won't
    be found in BufNewFile,BufReadPost events because <afile> is expand()'ed
    before it is used as a key for s:temp_files.
    In the end, user gets cryptic error message about
    "C:\LongDirName\VI12345.tmp.fugitiveblame" not being a git repository
    when he tries to open a commit in Gblame window.
    
    To workaround that we expand paths of temp files when adding entries to
    s:temp_files. Also, because expand() can't expand short path if it
    doesn't exist in the file system, we have to extract the directory part
    and expand it separately.

    :Gbrowse remote/branch should not resolve upstream
    
    Old behavior: Follow remote/branch to local branch to upstream,
    wherever that happens to live.
    
    New behavior: Open branch at remote, without further resolution.

    Stricter match for fugitive:// buffers (#872)
    
    Fixes #871
    
    It is valid - though odd - to open a file at `some//path`. In that case
    the current check for fugitive buffers matches and changes &path
    unexpectedly. A stricter match against `://` prevents this.

    Don't use spaces in Git command to avoid problems under Windows
    
    When using a helper script to make Windows Vim work with Cygwin Git, arguments
    containing spaces don't survive being passed through "cmd /c" to this script
    and are decomposed into several tokens.
    
    Just use "%x20" instead of spaces in the pretty format to avoid the problem.

    Expand `%` instead of `<amatch>` in the Buf* autocommands
    
    This is relevant in case a previous BufReadPost autocmd changes the file
    name using `:file` - fugitive should use the new/current name then.

    ReplaceCmd: redirect stderr to tmp file / buffer
    
    The option `status.showUntrackedFiles=all` used with `git status` for
    `:Gstatus` might cause an error, which then causes fugitive to display an
    empty status window / index file.
    
    Redirecting the stderr output is useful in this case.
    
    The generated command was:
    
        git --git-dir=/home/user/.dotfiles/.git -c 'status.displayCommentPrefix=true' -c 'color.status=false' -c 'status.short=false' -c 'status.showUntrackedFiles=all' status
    
    The error from git is related to submodules being moved to another
    subdirectory, where the relative "gitdir" now does not exist anymore:
    
        fatal: Not a git repository: vim/bundle.old.nobackup/CLEAN/colorscheme-base16/../../../.git/modules/vim/bundle/colorscheme-base16
    
    While that's a Git / user error after all, fugitive should be more
    helpful in that case by displaying the error.
    
    It uses the 'shellpipe' setting to detect if '2>&1' is supported (Ref:
    https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/pull/661#issuecomment-120438667).
    
    Closes #661.

    Add "stash" and stash refs in repo.superglob
    
    This looks for `refs/stash` and calls `git stash list` to get all of
    them in case it exists.

    Allow using the "%" variable in git commands
    
    Closes https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/issues/686
    
    For example, when running:
    
      :Git add %
    
    neovim throws the following exception:
    
      E499: Empty file name for '%' or '#',
      only works with ":p:h": terminal git add %
    
    It is a result of the tabnew command, it creates a new blank tab where
    "%" is empty.
    
    This commit changes "tabnew" to "tabedit %" so you're still working on
    the same file.
    
    Once the command is done running the tab closes.

    Show all untracked files in :Gstatus window
    
    Previously, if there were untracked files inside an untracked folder,
    :Gstatus would only show the new folder. Attempting to run a diff on the
    folder would pass the directory name, which would result in Vim opening
    a directory listing. This makes :Gstatus list all untracked files, even
    if they're inside untracked folders. This requires Git >=1.4, and will
    silently fall back to the old behavior on earlier versions.
    
    Closes #605.

    This implements the changes suggested in tpope/fugitive#415.
    s:repo_configured_tree is now a global, s:configured_tree() that caches
    the bidirectional relation between the worktree and the git_dir.
    extract_git_dir() now uses that relation to check whether the
    directories it scans are valid worktrees known by the repo at $GIT_DIR.

    Ignore E302 "Could not rename swap file" error
    
    According to `:help E302`, E302 comes from Vim being unable to rename
    the swap file when an open buffer's name is changed; but the error is
    mostly harmless. E302 seems to occur in vim-fugitive under Windows but
    not *nix.
    
    This fix allow :Glog and :Gdiff to work on such systems; previously the
    uncaught error made these operations fail or at least work strangely.

    Fix Gblame problems on Windows
    
    On Windows, if Vim is invoked with a working directory starting with a
    lowercase drive letter (e.g. c:\<path> instead of C:\<path>), some
    mappings in the blame buffer do not work correctly.  For example,
    hitting Enter on a line throws an exception rather than showing the
    associated commit.  The reason for this is that the b:git_dir variable
    is not being set on the blame buffer.  The reason in turn for this is
    that the path to the blame buffer is being stored in s:temp_files with
    an uppercase drive letter, but in the fugitive_temp augroup, '<afile>:p'
    is being expanded with a lowercase drive letter, so the lookup in
    s:temp_files fails.  Fix this by converting paths to lowercase before
    using them as keys for the s:tempfile dictionary.  Because of the way
    Vim generates temporary file names, this is safe even on platforms with
    case-sensitive file systems.

    where the user wishes the Git directory to be customized. In the case
    the user has set these using environment variables, vim-fugitive takes
    advantage of these settings in order to set up.
    
    Note that git-config(1) allows setting the work-tree and Git dir in
    a number of ways (see the core.worktree) setting. This change only
    respects the environment variable method, not the config file method.

    Fix slowness when searching for networked git repos under Cygwin.
    
    The algorithm in fugitive#extract_git_dir() is to move upwards in the
    file system hierarchy until a sub-directory called .git is found. When
    accessing a file on a network share from a Cygwin Vim and the file is not
    within a git repo, this eventually causes a check for the existence of
    //serverName/.git and //.git. Such checks are extremely slow so let's
    avoid them.

    Pick sane git_dir for :Gedit from :Gstatus window
    
    When using a :Gedit command from the :Gstatus window the git_dir was
    being based on the window that was switched into in order to edit the
    file. So if Fugitive switched into a window with a file from a different
    Git repo (or a file with no Git repo) the :Gedit command could fail or
    edit the wrong file.
    
    Instead base the git_dir on the window from which the :Gedit command
    originated.

    Return to correct window when closing Gblame window
    
    Vim does not guarantee persistent window numbers. Instead, windows are
    numbered according to their position on the screen, with the topmost,
    leftmost window always having number 1, and the bottommost, rightmost
    window always having a number equal to the total number of windows
    currently visible. Crucially, this means that, when a window is closed,
    windows which come "after" it in the positional order will be
    renumbered.
    
    When fugitive's Gblame window is closed, e.g. by pressing `q`, it
    attempts to return focus to the window of the blamed buffer. Previously,
    the number of the window to return to was computed before closing the
    Gblame window, then the Gblame window was closed, then the blamed
    buffer's window was focused. However, since windows were often
    renumbered as soon as the Gblame window was closed, this would
    frequently cause focus to jump to the window *after* the blamed buffer's
    window, rather than the intended behavior.
    
    This corrects the issue by jumping to the proper return window prior to
    deleting the Gblame buffer, ensuring that the computed window number is
    in fact correct at the moment when the focus change occurs.

    Support submodules on 1.7.10
    
    In 1.7.10, the git-file switched from using an absolute to a relative
    path.  Treat any path starting with "." as relative.  (A more robust
    check for a relative path is more complicated than looking for a leading
    slash because of Windows.)

    Add fugitive#head() and fugitive#repo().head()
    
    fugitive#head() returns the name of the current branch. If the current
    HEAD is detached, fugitive#head() will return the empty string, unless
    the optional 'len' argument is given, in which case the hash of the
    current HEAD will be truncated to 'len' characters.
    
    This makes should make life easier for people who don't want to use the
    default provided by fugitive#statusline()

    Fix garbage during :Gcommit with alternate screen
    
    When running Vim in a terminal with an alternate screen buffer, :Gcommit
    trashes the screen in a way that requires a redraw to fix.  Circumvent
    this by using system() rather than `silent !`.  Fixes #68.

    This reverts commit 68b3f3b3d6e8e01bf1c60b22745db731356349cc.  Since
    :saveas changes the alternate file, :Gmove should too.

    Mitigate conflict with DirDiff plugin

    only disabling diff mode when b:git_dir matches.

    Rename fugitive#buffer().name() to spec()
    
    In rails.vim, path() and name() have the opposite (and dare I say more
    intuitive) semantic of that found in fugitive.vim.  An outright switch
    would be a little violent, so for now, rename name() to spec() (as in
    "file spec").

commit 56b8ad786b7cb0e49a7bcea76bedd8535caa1146
Author: Tim Pope <code@tpope.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 19 19:59:08 2010 -0400

    Allow double quotes in :Git and :Ggrep arguments
    
    :Git and :Ggrep were defined with the -bar flag, which enables chaining
    (`:Ggrep foo | copen`) but also comments (`:Ggrep foo " find foo).  The
    former is useful but the latter prevents one from using double quotes
    with commands.  Instead, let's disable -bar and fake it in the
    implementation.
    
    :Git implements chaining in a way that's hopefully the same as the way
    Vim itself chains.  :Ggrep is a little different; it only chains after a
    quote or a space so that `:Ggrep -e 'foo|bar'|copen` works as one would
    expect.

    Partial support for csh and cmd.exe
    
    Both csh and cmd.exe are painful to script and may never be completely
    supported.  In both cases, you will be better suited by just overriding
    the shell:
    
      set shell=/bin/sh
    
    Use of cmd.exe currently requires you to set shellslash.
